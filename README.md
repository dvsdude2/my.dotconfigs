#### More than just dotconfigs

    keep configs to save the work I put into making them.
plan on keeping a lot of my arch set up here. so not all config files
the plan is to use these settings for any new builds in future.

#### Installation

use [**git**  ](https://git-scm.com/ "download git") to clone

```python

#### Usage

after clean install of a new ISO
use these files to get back all the customizing
